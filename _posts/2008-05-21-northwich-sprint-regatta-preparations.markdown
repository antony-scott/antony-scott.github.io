This weekend just gone I've been doing quite a lot of rowing. Saturday was a session in a quad, which was hard work. Personally, I don't enjoy going out in a quad as much as a double or a 4. I think that's just down to the fact that I'm still pretty raw at sculling and the quad moves much quicker than a double, so I find myself being rushed all the time.

On Sunday morning I was out in the 4, which I thought went really well, for me anyway. I don't think the other guys were too impressed, at least during the first part of the session. But, things improved drastically in the latter part. I was quite surprised how quickly I got back into sweep oar, as I've not been out in anything but quads and doubles for a few months now. I found myself enjoying the outing much more than any outing I have recently, I guess sweep oar is more familiar territory to me. I really felt like I was helping the boat run smoothly and in the last 20-30 seconds of the pieces we were doing I felt like I could get some real pressure on. It remains to be seen how that will translate into a performance in the 8 on Monday.

Yesterday I was back in a quad, this time doing flat out 1 minute pieces with a minutes rest between. I really have lost a lot of fitness recently, because I've backed right off training due to a back injury. Still, it'll come back pretty quickly once I get going on the ergo regularly. John was at stroke and was quite difficult to follow because he hasn't got the 2-to-1 ratio of recovery-to-drive yet. So, it all felt a bit rushed and even panicked at times. But, credit where it's due, after a few pointers he really improved that quite significantly. One of the guys got a twinge in his back, an old injury, so we decided to not take part in the return journey flat-out pieces, and paddled back. Towards the end of that return paddle the boat seemed to sit quite nicely and we got some good rhythm going.

Anyway, during the 1 minute flat-out pieces we did take part in, I managed to cope with the rate (mid-30s). So that was quite pleasing. I was also pleased that I had the time to figure out what I was doing wrong whenever I caught a bad stroke and correct it for the next one.

So, it's all progressing nicely. Even though it doesn't feel like it at times, and I begin to question what a 36 year old bloke is doing even thinking about doing these things! But, if you don't push yourself beyond your limits, what's the point right?!
