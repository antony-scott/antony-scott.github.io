On the 25th and 26th of July I competed at Bewdley regatta. Again, concentrating on the coxless quad, but this time in 2 events per day. Unfortunately, we didn't come away with any pots although we did get through to all the finals. I can't remember which category we competed twice in, but we did compete in Intermediate 1, 2 and 3 in varying crew combinations.

Although we came away without any pots we did have close races and were encouraged by how close to the Intermediate 1 crew we were.

We had good weather on the Saturday, very hot at times. But Sunday turned into a downpour for most of the day.
