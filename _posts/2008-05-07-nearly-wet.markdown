# Nearly wet

I went out in a double with a fellow inexperienced rower last night. It almost got very wet. We were struggling to keep the boat balanced. Because we were both a bit raw neither of us knew if the imbalance on any given stroke was down to us or the other guy!

Anyway, we ended up stuck in amongst some debris which was attached to a bridge support! Captain Pete to the rescue, he expertly steered his boat and nudged us free. We then had to allow ourselves to drift through the bridge, turn around and come back through.

A bit scary at one point, but we were okay in the end.

We didn't really achieve very much other than getting in the way of a lot of other boats :(
