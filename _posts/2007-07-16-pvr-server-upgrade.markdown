I recently upgraded the PVR to the following hardware spec :-
- AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+
- 2 Gig DDR2-800 RAM<
- 2 x 500 Gig SATA drives
- 1 x 320 Gig IDE drive
- 1 x 160 Gig IDE drive
- Codegen Rackmount case
- 2 x Hauppauge Nova-T 500 capture cards (1 is currently RMA\'d to Hauppauge)
- 2 x Hauppauge Nova-T capture cards

So, when I get the Nova-T 500 returned from Hauppauge I will have 6 digital tuners in it. That should cope  with demand for 2 people!

It's currently running on Windows Home Server CTP. But i have bought another copy of Windows MCE 2005 as I'm finding WHS far  too slow and it also causes problems with my PVR software.

The plan is the move the entire rack in which the PVR is situation from the attic area  downstairs into the garage, so it'll be more accessible and easier to cool. It  can get quite toasty up in the attic.
