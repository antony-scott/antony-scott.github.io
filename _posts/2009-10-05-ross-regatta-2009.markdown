On the 31st of August I raced at Ross Regatta in a coxed 4 and a coxless quad. Having survived the previous evenings antics, ending up in a shot drinking spree and then bearing witness to some drunken streaking, I was lucky in that my races weren't until later on in the day!

We got through to the final, but lost by a length or thereabouts despite a big final push for the line. The coxed four didn't go so well and we lost in our first heat.

All things considered a good weekend, and quite encouraging that we managed to win our first race at Intermediate 1 level and came so close to an event win.
