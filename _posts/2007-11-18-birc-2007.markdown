Well, I heeded my own lesson and said "no" to going to the BIRC this year.

I have a strained ligament in my back, which causes considerable pain and reduces my flexibility. It happened for the first time about 4 months  ago, and flared up again recently. In fact, about a week after I'd paid my entry fee of Â£20 for the BIRC (British Indoor Rowing Championships). So, I decided this morning not to go and risk causing further damage.

I find it quite annoying that Concept2 wouldn't refund my entry fee despite having a medical reason for not competing.
