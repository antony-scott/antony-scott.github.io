I've been developing software in one form or another for the last 40 years.
I started coding in BASIC on a Dragon 32 back in the early 80s, moving to a
custom built PC, coding in Pascal, C and C++ fairly soon after that.

In my professional life I develop solutions using Microsoft technologies
using C# as my main language, but am fluent in a number of other languages.
